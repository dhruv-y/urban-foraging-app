# Forage - An Urban Foraging App

## Description

Forage was developed as part of I527 - Mobile and Pervasive Design, taught by Dr. Patrick Shih at Indiana University, along with Dr. Dana Habeeb (Environmental Planning and Urban Climatology) who was our mentor and provided us with real-world urban foraging data in Bloomington. The final deliverable was a result of an elaborate design process which included various phases for concept development, requirement gathering, user surveys/interviews, needs assessment, iterative design and prototype implementation.

Forage is a React Native + Firebase based application for Urban Foraging. This app primarily uses Firebase to maintain tree and user data, along with React Native (and supported libraries) to view and control the data. Some of the features included are: 

    • User Management
    • Interactive Edible Tree Map
    • Elaborate Tree Details w/ User Notes
    • Managing Favorite Trees and Filtering

## Setup

Currently, the application is supported for Android devices/emulators and hasn't been tested on iPhones which is why it may break due to varying library support for the two devices.

• Node.js and NPM need to be installed in your environment as a prerequisite for development purposes.

• The repo can be cloned locally by using the following command

    `git clone https://github.com/dhruv-y/urban-foraging-app.git`

• To start the app through expo, navigate to the root and run

    `expo start`

*NOTE* - The firebase config file is not available publicly due to security concerns which might raise errors after cloning the repo. You can contact me at [dyadwad@iu.edu](https://github.com/dhruv-y) for help with this.
